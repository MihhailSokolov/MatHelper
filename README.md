# MatHelper
Visual Basic.NET Desktop application developed in 8th grade as a school project for converting different measurement units
 ## How to run
 - Open `MatHelper.sln` in your Visual Studio and press `Start` button
 - Or go to MatHelper/obj/Debug and run `MatHelper.exe`
 
 ## Usage
 Unfortunately, the application os only available in Russian langauge because I wrote it in 8th grade for 4th-graders to learn about different units of measurements.
 - You can select different categories and choose different measurement units from those categories and convert them
 - There are also some additional functions like showing explanatory picture of certain measurement unit in the web browser and calculator and finding average from multiple number and etc.
